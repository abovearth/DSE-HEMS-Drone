D = dimension of full image
d = dimension of image of target

The sensed image, which includes the target, is displayed on a monitor, where it can be measured.

Dimensions of the full image display and of the portion of the image that is the target are determined by inspection (measurements are typically in pixels, but can just as well be inches or cm).




Assuming the sensed image includes the whole target, the angle seen by the camera, its FOV, is this angular extent of the target times the ratio of full image size to target image size.

The target's angular extent is:

{\displaystyle \alpha =2\arctan {\frac {L}{2f_{c}}}}\alpha =2\arctan {\frac {L}{2f_{c}}}

where {\displaystyle L}L is the dimension of the target and {\displaystyle f_{c}}f_{c} is the focal length of collimator.






The total field of view is then approximately:

{\displaystyle \mathrm {FOV} =\alpha {\frac {D}{d}}}
